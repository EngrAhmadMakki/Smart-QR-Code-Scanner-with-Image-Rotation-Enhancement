# Smart-QR-Code-Scanner-with-Image-Rotation-Enhancement
This project is a robust QR code scanner that detects QR codes from images, even if they are rotated, skewed, or slightly blurry. By applying image preprocessing techniques like rotation, grayscale conversion, and sharpening, the scanner significantly improves QR detection accuracy and saves annotated results with highlighted QR codes.
